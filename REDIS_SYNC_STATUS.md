# Redis Sync Status Report

## Current Issue
The Redis API at `https://redis-api-705890714749.europe-west2.run.app` is returning 404 errors for all endpoints, indicating:

1. **Redis service is down/not deployed**
2. **Different endpoint structure than expected**
3. **Authentication/routing issues**

## PostgreSQL Data (Source of Truth)
The Customer Portal maintains PostgreSQL as the authoritative data source for:
- User credits and account information
- API keys and their status
- Usage tracking and transaction history

## Current Behavior
- **Credit deductions**: Working correctly in PostgreSQL
- **Usage tracking**: Recording properly in database
- **Redis sync**: Failing but non-blocking (system continues to work)
- **API validation**: Falls back to PostgreSQL queries

## Impact Analysis
- **Performance**: Slightly slower API validation (PostgreSQL vs Redis)
- **Functionality**: All core features working normally
- **Data consistency**: Maintained (PostgreSQL is authoritative)

## Resolution Options

### Option 1: Fix Redis Service
- Deploy/restart the Redis API service
- Verify correct endpoint structure
- Test authentication and connectivity

### Option 2: Alternative Redis Implementation
- Use direct Redis connection instead of HTTP API
- Implement Redis client library integration
- Bypass the HTTP API layer

### Option 3: Continue Without Redis (Current State)
- PostgreSQL handles all operations
- System fully functional but with higher latency
- No data loss or consistency issues

## Recommendation
The system is currently stable and functional without Redis. The credit flow architecture is working correctly with PostgreSQL as the source of truth. Redis sync can be resolved later without affecting core functionality.

## System Status: âœ… OPERATIONAL
- Credit usage tracking: Working
- User authentication: Working  
- API key management: Working
- Usage reporting: Working
- Redis caching: Degraded (non-critical)
